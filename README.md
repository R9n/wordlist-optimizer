## How to use 🚀

To see how to use the tool, just type wlop in the terminal. If the installation was done correctly you should see instructions on the screen

**Usage 1**: wlopt [word list path] [save result path] [flags]

-**c** to include passwords with uppercase letters

-**l** to include passwords with lowercase letters

-**s** to include passwords with the following special symbols: [!@#$%^&*(),.?\":{}|<>]

-**r** followed by custom regex to filter passwords

-**n** to include passwords with numbers

-**max** followed by an integer to include passwords with maximum length

-**min** followed by an integer to include passwords of minimum length

Example:

wlopt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt /usr/share/wordlists -c -l -n -min 5 -max 8 -r "test"

The above command filters passwords with:

- capital letter (-c)
- with lowercase letters (-l)
- with numbers (-n)
- with a minimum duration of 5 (-min 5)
- with a maximum length of 8 (-max 8)
- with the word "test" in the text

and saving to /usr/share/wordlists

The optimized file will have the following name **optimized-xxx.txt** where xxx is the name of the input word list file

The file with all passwords that **did not**  meet the filter will be written to **removed-xxx.txt** where xxx is the name of the input word list file

## Popular Patterns Filtering

If you want, you can directly filter some popular password patterns:

**Usage 2**: wlopt [word list path] [save result path] -service

where the service can be:

- aws
- gmail
- hotmail
- tiktok
- wiFi
- ssh
- facebook
- instagram
- alibaba
- yahoo
- ibm
- windows
- linkedIn

Example:

wlopt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt /usr/share/wordlists -wifi

**NOTE**: You can select only one service

## Performance 📈

Here we have an test filtering for passwords with capital letters, lowercase letters, special simbols and with min length of 5 caracteres on a wordlist of 14 millions of passwords. As you can see, it took less than an minute :)
